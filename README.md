# Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you’ll find a curated set of academic and self-driven projects demonstrating my skills in Python, data analytics, machine learning, and visualization. These projects represent my ongoing development as a data-focused problem solver.

# Project 1: Portfolio Risk Analysis
In this project, I created a portfolio of seven NYSE-traded assets and performed a comprehensive risk analysis. The portfolio's performance was compared against major indices such as the S&P 500 (SPY), Russell 2000 (IWM), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA). 
# Project 2: Portfolio Optimization with Efficient Frontier
This project involved selecting a basket of seven assets, calculating their individual risk/return values, and combining them to create the efficient frontier. Two methods were used for optimization: the Monte Carlo method and linear regression. The results were plotted to visualize the optimal portfolio combinations.

# Project 3: Long-Short Portfolio Backtesting
This project focused on building a long-short portfolio using Berry Cox’s price momentum factors. The strategy was backtested using five years of historical data to evaluate its performance. The goal was to assess the effectiveness of the momentum-based strategy in generating returns while managing risk.

#Messi vs Real Betis — Soccer Analytics Project
This project analyzes Lionel Messi’s performance against Real Betis using spatial event data. The goal is to explore how Messi progressed the ball, where he operated on the pitch, and how his actions contributed to attacking sequences. The project uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and mplsoccer to visualize passes, movements, and heat density patterns.
