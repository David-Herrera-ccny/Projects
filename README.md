Portfolio Analysis and Backtesting Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains three distinct projects focused on portfolio analysis, optimization, and backtesting. Each project explores different aspects of financial data analysis, from risk assessment to algorithmic trading strategies. Below is a brief overview of each project:

# Project 1: Portfolio Risk Analysis
Description
In this project, I created a portfolio of seven NYSE-traded assets and performed a comprehensive risk analysis. The portfolio's performance was compared against major indices such as the S&P 500 (SPY), Russell 2000 (IWM), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA). The analysis included calculating statistical metrics, determining optimal portfolio weights, and visualizing the efficient frontier.

# Project 2: Portfolio Optimization with Efficient Frontier
Description
This project involved selecting a basket of seven assets, calculating their individual risk/return values, and combining them to create the efficient frontier. Two methods were used for optimization: the Monte Carlo method and linear regression. The results were plotted to visualize the optimal portfolio combinations.

# Project 3: Long-Short Portfolio Backtesting
Description
This project focused on building a long-short portfolio using Berry Coxâ€™s price momentum factors. The strategy was backtested using five years of historical data to evaluate its performance. The goal was to assess the effectiveness of the momentum-based strategy in generating returns while managing risk.
